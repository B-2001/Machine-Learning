# üìà Store Sales Forecasting

This project performs **time series analysis and forecasting** on sales data from a furniture store. Using ARIMA and SARIMA models, we aim to predict future sales trends by analyzing historical transactional data.

## üìä Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning

* Checked data types, missing values, and duplicates
* Dropped non-contributing columns (`Row ID`, `Customer Name`, etc.)
* Converted `Order Date` to datetime and set it as index
* Aggregated data to monthly frequency for time series modeling

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Sales, Quantity, Discount, and Profit distributions
* Monthly sales trends
* Scatter plots between Sales and Profit
* Time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residual)

### 3. Stationarity Check

* Applied **ADF Test** to validate stationarity of the sales data
* Result: Stationary (p-value < 0.05)

### 4. Model Building

* **ARIMA(5,1,0)**
* **SARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1,12)** for capturing seasonal effects

### 5. Forecasting & Visualization

* Forecasted sales for the test period using both models
* Compared model predictions with actual data
* Visualized results with Matplotlib and Plotly

## üìà Visualizations

* Distribution plots (Sales, Quantity, Profit)
* Monthly Sales Line Plot
* Seasonal Decomposition
* ACF & PACF plots

## üß™ Model Summary

| Model  | AIC    | Seasonal | Key Insight                      |
| ------ | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| ARIMA  | 790.99 | ‚ùå        | Simpler model, higher AIC        |
| SARIMA | 510.05 | ‚úÖ        | Captures seasonality, better fit |

> SARIMA performs significantly better than ARIMA due to seasonal nature of data.

## üß† Key Learnings

* Time series models like SARIMA handle seasonality better than basic ARIMA.
* Importance of making time series stationary before modeling.
* EDA helps identify unnecessary features and data patterns.
* Forecasting requires consistent resampling and clean datetime indexing.

## üîß Libraries Used

* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
* `statsmodels`, `sklearn`
